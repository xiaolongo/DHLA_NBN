## Node representaion learning
To run this code to perform the node classification for PPI, you should first modify the parameter "model=GCN_with_DHLA or SAGE_with_DHLA or GAT_with_DHLA" in ./script/run_ppi.sh, and run

```makrdown
./script/run_ppi.sh
```
The final results can be find in ./results.
